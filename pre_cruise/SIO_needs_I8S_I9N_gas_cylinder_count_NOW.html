    <p>Dear I8S/I9N PIs and participants,</p>

    <p>SIO must now prepare sufficient gas bottle storage racks on R/V Roger Revelle to handle all the expected gas cylinders for the I8S/I9N cruise.</p>

    <p>Please update and verify your gas cylinder usage for this cruise.</p>

    <p>Please send your reply to the SIO Resident Technicians at email address restech@sdsioa.ucsd.edu, with copies to us (jswift@ucsd.edu &amp; jsprintall@ucsd.edu).</p>

    <p>No need to reply if you are not bringing or using gas cylinders.</p>


    <p>Number and description of cylinders.<br />
    Where you prefer to load the cylinders (San Diego, Dunedin, or Perth). <br />
    Notes about usage (i.e. X can be stored and rotated to lab, where Y will be in use at a time, or something like that). <br />
    Anything else you think we should know about your gas cylinders.</p>

    <p>Please reply soon.</p>
<br />
    <p>Thanks.</p>

    <p>Jim &amp; Janet</p>
