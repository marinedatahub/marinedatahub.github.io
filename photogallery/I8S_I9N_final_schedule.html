    <p>re: I8S/I9N &ldquo;final&rdquo; schedule</p>
<br />
    <p>Dear I8S/I9N participants and other interested people:</p>

    <p>We have carefully examined the CLIVAR/CO2 I8S/I9N cruise plans vis-&#224;-vis the preliminary schedule from SIO for R/V Roger Revelle.</p>

    <p>The Captain of R/V Roger Revelle has calculated the steaming time from Dunedin, New Zealand, to the first I8S station, taking into account expected winds, currents, seas, and ice conditions.  His estimate is 14 days.  Together with our plan for the remainder of Leg 1, this makes Leg 1 a total of 43 &ldquo;UNOLS&rdquo; days at sea.</p>

    <p>Our recalculation of the Leg 2 (I9N) cruise plan leads us to request 42 UNOLS days at sea for that leg.</p>

    <p>The previous schedule from SIO had enough days in it, but distributed differently.  Hence we requested to move the Perth/Fremantle port stop originally 21-25 March to 20-24 March.  No other change is needed.</p>

    <p>Our revised schedule is shown below.  SIO Ship Scheduling has agreed to this.</p>

    <p>There is a UNOLS ship scheduling meeting next week.  No changes to this schedule are expected. Of course, changes are possible, for example due to an unplanned and urgently needed repair.</p>

    <p>Best Regards,<br />
    Janet &amp; Jim</p>

    <p>PS from Jim for Leg 1 participants:  Yes, 14 days is a very long steam.  Be sure to take this into account in your planning.  Thanks!</p>
	<br />
