    <p>Dear I8S/I9N Colleagues,</p>

    <p>I was just now informed by SIO Ship Scheduling that there will be a pre-cruise meeting for the upcoming R/V Roger Revelle expedition on 13 September 2006, beginning at 9AM, at the SIO Marine Facility.  I expect this meeting to take up most of that morning.  The meeting will include representatives from other Revelle cruises which are part of the same overall expedition.</p>

    <p>There is no reason for most I8S/I9N participants, other than the Chief Scientists, to attend.  If you have special needs that you think Janet and I won&rsquo;t represent correctly, we can have you call in to the meeting.  Let me know what works for you.</p>

    <p>Measurement team leaders, it will be very helpful if you can send me the usual pre-cruise planning information no later than Tuesday, September 12th:</p>

    <blockquote> number of berths requested each leg
		<br />
     lab space requirements
		<br />
     lab facility requirements
		<br />
     storage requirements (including environmental constraints)
		<br />
     van requirements
		<br />
     items you really, really want to load in San Diego (e.g. HAZMATS)
		<br />
       &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; (description, volume or weight, special considerations)
		<br />
     items you would like to load in San Diego if room is available
		<br />
        &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;(description, volume or weight, special considerations)
		<br />
     additional HAZMAT items not covered in above categories
		<br />
     anything else you think we should know</blockquote>

    <p>The emphasis on HAZMATS is partly due to the specialized storage, handling, and paperwork required.  You know the rules, and you know why we must know the types of materials and their volumes.  Please also remember that you cannot leave a HAZMAT on board the ship after I9N without direct permission from SIO, and there is no reason to expect that permission to be forthcoming.</p>

    <p>Some of you have already sent me your information &#8230; thanks!!  I realize many who do not need to send me info are in the &ldquo;To&rdquo; list. I figure it&rsquo;s better to reach everyone at this point rather than try to be selective.</p>
		<br />
    <p>Best Regards,
		<br />
    Jim Swift</p>
