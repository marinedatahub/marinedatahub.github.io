	<p>re: I9N Station Plan

	<p>Dear I8S/I9N Participants and other Interested Parties,

	<p>After careful consideration we have made some adjustments to the northern section of the I9N cruise track in the Bay of Bengal. The attached map shows the revised cruise track and station plans (red diamonds) that will avoid the approximated position of the Indian EEZ (faint white line to east of revised track). The &ldquo;original&rdquo; cruise track is shown in the yellow diamonds.

	<p>This new station plan takes nearly the same amount of time as did the original station plan, and so the I8S/I9N Schedule sent by email on 27 September 2006 (and appended below) remains unchanged.

	<p>all the best,<br />
	Janet and Jim</p>
<br />
