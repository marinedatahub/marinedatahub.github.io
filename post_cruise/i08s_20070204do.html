The leg, from Dunedin, New Zealand, to                                  Fremantle, Australia, was a repeat of the WOCE line I8S, last carried                               out aboard R/V Knorr during December 1994.                                                                                                                                                              Loading commenced in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 31 January 2007.  The                                 ship was left in fine condition by the previous science group.  Loading                             went smoothly, and a good relationship between science team and crew                                was already building.  We loaded three lab vans, cargo from three other                             containers, plus numerous other shipments.  SIO Shipboard Technical                                 Support gets special kudos for providing four Resident Technicians to                               assist during loading - all of whom were friendly and helpful, not to                               mention very busy.  Chief Engineer Paul Mauricio and his team                                       cheerfully set to work fixing the trace metal winch, which had been                                 damaged in shipping.  After a "happy hour" for all hands at the                                     Speight's brew pub, on Saturday evening, the ship left the dock Sunday,                             04 February 2007, at 1606 local time in good weather, Captain Dave                                  Murline in command.                                                                                                                                                                                     The plan was to complete the first occupation of Indian Ocean transects                             for the US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography program, which                                contributes to both the CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography project and the                                   International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project via decadal                                         reoccupations of selected high-priority WOCE Hydrographic Program                                   transects.  The science program followed or improved on the WOCE                                    protocols, with enhanced measurements of ocean carbon parameters in                                 particular, plus a trace metal sampling program.  Sampling and                                      analytical work for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients,                             a host of carbon-related parameters, CFCs, helium, tritium, radiocarbon,                            trace metals, and velocity were planned from surface-to-bottom at ca.                               50 km intervals along ca. 95&deg;E from Antarctica to Bangladesh, along                                 with acquisition of data from a number of underway sampling systems,                                plus deployment of Argo floats.                                                                                                                                                                         The cruise began with a long steam to the first station, located in one                             of the most remote reaches of the World Ocean, with the goal of                                     carrying out the first station on the intended track as close to                                    Antarctica as ice, weather, and the captain would permit.  We headed                                southwest across the 40s and 50s, making most westward progress south                               of 60&deg;S, south of the strongest headwinds, swell, and opposing                                      currents.  A further benefit was some westward currents and occasional                              following seas.  Hence we arrived somewhat ahead of schedule in the                                 region where we hoped to make our close approach to Antarctica.  To                                 approach the continental shelf break we required (1) working near the                               time of the local annual sea ice minimum (provided thanks to the ship                               schedulers), (2) useful satellite ice edge imagery and analyses (kindly                             provided for us real time by the Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center), (3)                                   navigational expertise (no problem with Captain Murline and his bridge                              staff in charge), and (4) a truly significant dose of good luck.                                                                                                                                        We had been out of satellite communications (including email) for a few                             days, partly due to not being able to aim the ship's antenna low enough                             on the horizon to see geostationary satellites, and partly because SIO                              had to put together, ashore and at sea, the technical and business                                  pieces to effect a transfer to an Indian Ocean satellite as we left                                 behind the footprint of the Pacific one.  But just when we needed the                               connection to receive ice images, the satellite connection was                                      reestablished, and updated ice images arrived.  One of the SIO grad                                 students along, JJ Becker, works with SIO's Dave Sandwell, an expert in                             teasing out ocean bathymetry from satellite data.  JJ had along on his                              computer the latest bottom depth information.  Combined with the ice                                edge information, plus our operational limits, this influenced our plan                             to approach along 84 degrees, 35 minutes east longitude, in the western                             Davis Sea.  It turned out to be a good choice, and in hindsight perhaps                             was the only one which would have worked: As we proceeded south, the                                bottom beneath us rose, but meanwhile the ice was getting closer.  Just                             when Captain Murline said "no further" the real-time bathymetry data                                showed that we'd reached our goal of the 500 meter isobath.                                                                                                                                             We lowered our instruments there for our first station, the late day                                sun illuminating the sea ice, with icebergs all about, in an embayment                              of open water, killer whales patrolling the ice edge for seals and                                  penguins, seals on the ice not inclined to join them, soon into sunset                              with an aurora above.  Through the cold 25&deg;F night we completed our 500                             meter station, then the 1200 meter station offshore of that, then the                               2000 meter station, and so on, being chased north by encroaching ice,                               yet in the process completing a rare Antarctic shelf-slope-basin                                    transect from a non-ice-strengthened ship.                                                                                                                                                              We were not yet through our encounters with sea ice.  The ice images                                showed a tongue of sea ice spreading eastward from an nearby ice shelf,                             nearly across our planned path out from the Davis Sea to the 1994 I8S                               line.  Sure enough, on the way to station 7 and 8, sea ice provided an                              exciting moment, with parades of icebergs and myriad growlers about,                                causing a small detour.                                                                                                                                                                                 Three LADCPs were brought on the cruise, two newer 300kHz "workhorse"                               models (usually used in pairs), and one older "broadband" 150kHz                                    instrument.  Testing uncovered problems with the originally intended                                LADCP pair, and there were also some data issues with the back-up unit.                             The 300kHz instruments typically only perform well in regions of high                               scattering (e.g. high latitudes, due to higher productivity overall) so                             the plan was to use the 300kHz instruments for most of the first leg,                               and switch to the 150kHz instrument when scattering levels dropped in                               the desert-like subtropical gyre.  One of the 300kHz instruments was an                             experimental model with higher power and was to be field-tested during                              this cruise.  That instrument was rendered moot until its bulkhead                                  connector can be replaced (in Fremantle).  The remaining (more typical)                             300kHz instrument was used successfully until it started returning                                  casts with incomplete data.  The cause was unknown.  We switched to the                             150kHz instrument for the duration of the cruise.  It was heavier than                              the 300kHz instrument, and its extra weight may have helped the rosette                             sink better, too.                                                                                                                                                                                       During some CTD casts early in the cruise very slow descent rates were                              needed to 1000-1500m because wire tension was very low, even in                                     moderate to low sea states.  Since the rosette weighs ca. 1100 lbs.  in                             air, the reluctance to sink was puzzling.  Focus gradually centered on                              the Revelle's new CTD cable, which seemed to have a propensity to                                   develop kinks under roll and load conditions which seemed significantly                             less severe than experienced, with fewer problems, on some other                                    similar cruises.  Admittedly, we were working our way north through the                             50s, a tough area to work with a large rosette.  Still, our battle with                             cable kinks was perplexing because two years earlier we carried out a                               similar Southern Ocean transect (in the Pacific Ocean sector) from this                             ship with virtually the same equipment, and under occasionally trying                               sea conditions, but with few cable kink problems.  A working solution                               was elusive.  Finally we switched our rosette from the new CTD cable                                installed for this trip to the older CTD cable on the second winch, the                             cable used during the 2005 P16S cruise.  After that switch, CTD casts                               were completed without problems.  It thus seems plausible that the new                              cable had from its manufacture some intrinsic characteristic                                        incompatible with our rosette operations in swell.  We did not know                                 this with certainty, of course.                                                                                                                                                                         Late in the cruise we dealt with odd behavior from both the primary and                             back-up transmissometers.  This was finally tracked to a coincidence of                             faults in two cables, not the instruments.                                                                                                                                                              The rosette used on this cruise utilized Niskin-type "Bullister"                                    bottles which delivered 10.4 liters of samples, up from 9-liters with                               the previous generation of ODF "Bullister" bottles.  We found that it                               was possible to sample nearly all samples from a single bottle, except                              for the occasional 4-liter POC samples.                                                                                                                                                                 In addition to the usual cast of officers, crew, researchers, and                                   graduate students, we had a three-person public outreach team along.                                In delving into the grit of oceanographic field work, they hoped to                                 improve public understanding regarding how data that reflect the                                    changing state of climate are collected.  They plan to produce a                                    website, several articles, and multimedia features.  Their role on the                              ship was purposefully nebulous, something of a hybrid between research                              assistants and a media crew.  We integrated them into the science team                              by assigning them tasks that were, in their words, "difficult to ruin".                                                                                                                                 Their project continues to evolve based on the materials they gather                                and the opportunities that arise.  They shadowed the scientists and                                 shipboard technicians on their daily rounds, and were busy turning                                  interviews into short articles and film clips about our research.                                   Captain Murline helped considerably regarding coordinating the part of                              their work that provides a sense of the foundational support needed to                              run a cruise.                                                                                                                                                                                           We arrived dockside in Fremantle, Australia, the morning of 17 March,                               having completed not only all of the I8S line, with extension to the                                Antarctic continental shelf break, but also a few of the next leg's                                 stations on the northern end.  The plan was for the ship to stay in                                 Fremantle for about five days, then head back out to 95&deg;E to resume                                 northward on Leg 2 (called "I9N"), with Dr. Janet Sprintall (SIO) as                                chief scientist.  A handful of hardy souls in the I8S science team                                  stayed on for Leg 2, and of course most of the mariners of R/V Roger                                Revelle remained aboard.  The I8S team enjoyed the satisfaction of a                                job Very Well Done.  Officers, crew, science team - it was as strong                                and harmonious a ship's company one can ever experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                CLIVAR I08S PRELIMINARY CRUISE REPORT                                                               (15 MARCH 2007)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Data Submitted by:                                             Shipboard Technical Support/Oceanographic Data Facility                                                                 Scripps Institution of Oceanography                                                                            La Jolla, Ca. 92093-0214                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     INTRODUCTION                                                                                                                                                                                            A sea-going science team gathered from 8 oceanographic institutions                                 participated on the cruise.

The distribution of samples is illustrated in ﬁgures 1.0                      and 1.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                Figure 1.0: Sample distribution, stations 1-50.                                                     Figure 1.1: Sample distribution, stations 50-88.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1.1.  Water Sampling Package                                                                                                                                                                            CTD/rosette casts were performed with a package consisting of a 36-                                 bottle rosette frame (SIO/STS), a 36-place carousel (SBE32) and 36                                  10.5L Bullister bottles (SIO/STS).  Underwater electronic components                                consisted of a Sea-Bird Electronics SBE9plus CTD (SIO/STS #381) with                                dual pumps, dual temperature (SBE3plus), dual conductivity (SBE4),                                  dissolved oxygen (SBE43), transmissometer (Wetlabs), ﬂuorometer,                                    altimeter (Simrad) and LADCP (RDI).                                                                                                                                                                     The CTD was mounted vertically in an SBE CTD cage attached to the                                   bottom of the rosette frame and located to one side of the carousel.                                The SBE4 conductivity, SBE3plus temperature and SBE43 Dissolved oxygen                              sensors and their respective pumps and tubing were mounted vertically                               as recommended by SBE on a bracket adjacent to the CTD cage.  Pump                                  exhausts were attached to the sensor bracket on the side opposite from                              the sensors and directed downward.  The transmissometer and ﬂuorometer                              were mounted horizontally along the bottom of the rosette frame.  The                               altimeter was mounted on the inside of the bottom frame ring.  The RDI                              LADCP was mounted vertically on one side of the frame between the                                   bottles and the CTD.  Its battery pack was located on the opposite side                             of the frame, mounted on the bottom of the frame.                                                                                                                                                       The rosette system was suspended from a UNOLS-standard three-conductor                              0.322" electro-mechanical sea cable.  Three sea cable reterminations                                were made during I8S after casts 31/1, 32/1 and 33/2.                                                                                                                                                   The R/V Revelle's aft starboard-side Markey winch was used for casts                                1/1-33/2.  The forward starboard-side Markey winch was used for all                                 subsequent casts (34/2-88/3).  The decision was made to move from the                               aft Markey winch to the forward one after noticing irregularities in                                the construction of the aft winch sea cable.  The forward winch                                     sliprings were changed after cast 43/1.                                                                                                                                                                 The deck watch prepared the rosette 10-15 minutes prior to each cast.                               The bottles were cocked and all valves, vents and lanyards were checked                             for proper orientation.  Once stopped on station, the rosette was moved                             out from the aft hanger to the deployment location under the squirt                                 boom block using an air-powered cart and tracks.  The CTD was powered-                              up and the data acquisition system in the computer lab started when                                 directed by the deck watch leader.  The rosette was unstrapped from                                 it's tiedown location on the cart.  Tag lines were threaded through the                             rosette frame and syringes were removed from the CTD intake ports.  The                             winch operator was directed by the deck watch leader to raise the                                   package, the squirt boom and rosette were extended outboard and the                                 package quickly lowered into the water.  The tag lines were removed and                             the package was lowered to 10 meters, by which time the sensor pumps                                had turned on.  The winch operator was then directed to bring the                                   package back to the surface (0 winch wireout) and to begin the descent.                                                                                                                                 Each rosette cast was lowered to within 10-20 meters of the bottom,                                 using the altimeter, winch wireout, CTD depth and echosounder depth to                              determine the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                 During the up cast the winch operator was directed to stop the winch at                             each bottle trip depth.  The CTD console operator waited 30 seconds                                 before tripping a bottle to insure the package wake had dissipated and                              the bottles were ﬂushed, then an additional 10 seconds after each                                   bottle closure to insure that stable CTD comparison data had been                                   acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                               Once a bottle had been closed, the deck watch leader was directed to haul                           in the package to the next bottle stop.                                                                                                                                                                 Standard sampling depths were used throughout CLIVAR I8S.  These                                    standard depths were staggered every station using 3 sampling schemes.                                                                                                                                  Recovering the package at the end of the deployment was essentially the                             reverse of launching, with the additional use of poles and snap-hooks                               to attach tag lines.  The rosette was secured on the cart and moved                                 into the aft hanger for sampling.  The bottles and rosette were                                     examined before samples were taken, and anything unusual noted on the                               sample log.                                                                                                                                                                                             Each bottle on the rosette had a unique serial number.  This bottle                                 identiﬁcation was maintained independently of the bottle position on                                the rosette,  which was used for sample identiﬁcation.  Three bottles                               were replaced on this leg and various parts of bottles were                                         occasionally changed or repaired.                                                                                                                                                                       Routine CTD maintenance included soaking the conductivity and DO                                    sensors in fresh water between casts to maintain sensor stability and                               occasionally putting dilute Triton-X solution through the conductivity                              sensors to eliminate any accumulating bioﬁlms.  Rosette maintenance was                             performed on a regular basis.  O-rings were changed and lanyards                                    repaired as necessary.  Bottle maintenance was performed each day to                                insure proper closure and sealing.  Valves were inspected for leaks and                             repaired or replaced as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1.2.  Underwater Electronics Packages                                                                                                                                                                   CTD data were collected with a SBE9plus CTD (STS/ODF #381).  This                                   instrument provided pressure, dual temperature (SBE3), dual                                         conductivity (SBE4), dissolved oxygen (SBE43), CDOM ﬂuorometer                                      (Wetlabs), transmissometer (Wetlabs) and altimeter (Simrad 807)                                     channels.  The CTD supplied a standard SBE-format data stream at a data                             rate of 24 frames/second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Table 1.2.0: CLIVAR I8S Rosette Underwater Electronics.                                             _______________________________________________________________________                             Sea-Bird SBE32 36-place Carousel Water Sampler                                                      Sea-Bird SBE9plus CTD                          0381                                                 Paroscientiﬁc Digiquartz Pressure Sensor       S/N 58952                                            Sea-Bird SBE11plus Deck Unit                                                                        Sea-Bird SBE3plus Temperature Sensor           S/N 03P-4588 (Primary)                               Sea-Bird SBE3plus Temperature Sensor           S/N 03P-4226 (Secondary)                             Sea-Bird SBE4C Conductivity Sensor             S/N 04-3176 (Primary)                                Sea-Bird SBE4C Conductivity Sensor             S/N 04-3058 (Secondary)                              Sea-Bird SBE43 DO Sensor                       S/N 43-1129                                          Sea-Bird SBE5 Pump                             S/N 05-4160 (Primary)                                Sea-Bird SBE5 Pump                             S/N 05-4377 (Secondary)                              Sea-Bird SBE35 Reference Temperature Sensor    S/N 35-0035                                          Wetlabs CDOM Fluorometer                       S/N FLCDRTD-428                                      Wetlabs CStar Transmissometer                  S/N CST-327DR                                        Wetlabs CStar Transmissometer                  S/N CST-490DR                                        Simrad 807 Altimeter                           S/N 4051                                             RDI LADCPs                                                                                          _______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The CTD was outﬁtted with dual pumps.  Primary temperature,                                         conductivity and dissolved oxygen were plumbed into one pump circuit                                and secondary temperature and conductivity into the other.  The sensors                             were deployed vertically.  The primary temperature and conductivity                                 sensors (T1 #03P-4588 and C1 #04-3176) were used for reported CTD                                   temperatures and conductivities on all casts except 50/2, where                                     biofouling had rendered parts of the primary sensor record unusable.                                The secondary temperature and conductivity sensors were used as                                     calibration checks for all other casts.  ASBE35RT reference temperature                             sensor was connected to the SBE32 carousel and recorded a temperature                               for each bottle closure.  These temperatures were used as additional                                CTD calibration checks.                                                                                                                                                                                 The SBE9plus CTD was connected to the SBE32 36-place carousel providing                             for single-conductor sea cable operation.  The sea cable armor was used                             for ground (return).  Power to the SBE9plus CTD (and sensors), SBE32                                carousel and Simrad 807 altimeter was provided through the sea cable                                from the SBE11plus deck unit in the main lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1.3.  Navigation and Bathymetry Data Acquisition                                                                                                                                                        Navigation data were acquired at 1-second intervals from the ship's                                 GP90 GPS receiver by a Linux system beginning February 13.                                                                                                                                              Bathymetric data were logged from the Ship's Simrad EM120 multibeam                                 echosounder system and merged with the navigation time series.  These                               depths were corrected using sound velocity proﬁles derived from CTD                                 casts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1.4.  CTD Data Acquisition and Rosette Operation                                                                                                                                                        The CTD data acquisition system consisted of an SBE-11plus (V2) deck                                unit and three networked generic PC workstations running CentOS-4.4                                 Linux.  Each PC workstation was conﬁgured with a color graphics                                     display, keyboard, trackball and DVD+RW drive.  One of the systems also                             had 8 additional RS-232 ports via a Comtrol Rocketport PCI serial                                   controller.  The systems were interconnected through a 1000BaseTX                                   ethernet switch which was also connected to the ship's network.  These                              systems were available for real-time operational and CTD data displays,                             and provided for CTD and hydrographic data management and backup.                                                                                                                                       One of the workstations was designated the CTD console and was                                      connected to the CTD deck unit via RS-232.  The CTD console provided an                             interface and operational displays for controlling and monitoring a CTD                             deployment and closing bottles on the rosette.  Another of the                                      workstations was designated the website and database server and                                     maintained the hydrographic database for I8S.  All three systems were                               used to maintain redundant backups of the data.                                                                                                                                                         CTD deployments were initiated by the console watch after the ship had                              stopped on station.  The watch maintained a console operations log                                  containing a description of each deployment, a record of every attempt                              to close a bottle and any pertinent comments.  The deployment and                                   acquisition software presented a short dialog instructing the operator                              to turn on the deck unit, examine the on screen CTD data displays and                               to notify the deckwatch that this was accomplished.                                                                                                                                                     Once the deckwatch had deployed the rosette, the winch operator would                               lower it to 10 meters.  The CTD sensor pumps were conﬁgured with an 8                               second startup delay, and were usually on by this time.  The console                                operator checked the CTD data for proper sensor operation, waited an                                additional 60 seconds for sensors to stabilize, then instructed the                                 winch operator to bring the package to the surface and descend to a                                 target depth (wire-out).  The proﬁling rate was no more than 30m/min to                             50m, no more than 45m/min to 200m and no more than 60m/min deeper than                              200m depending on sea cable tension and the sea state.                                                                                                                                                  The progress of the deployment and CTD data quality were monitored                                  through interactive graphics and operational displays.  Bottle trip                                 locations were transcribed onto the console and sample logs.  The                                   sample log would later be used as an inventory of samples drawn from                                the bottles.  The altimeter channel, CTD depth, winch wire-out and                                  bathymetric depth were all monitored to determine the distance of the                               package from the bottom, usually allowing a safe approach to within 10-                             20 meters.                                                                                                                                                                                              Bottles were closed on the up cast by operating an on-screen control.                               The winch operator was given a target wire-out for the bottle stop,                                 proceeded to that depth and stopped.  Bottles were tripped at least 30                              seconds after stopping to allow the rosette wake to dissipate and the                               bottles to ﬂush.  The winch operator was instructed to proceed to the                               next bottle stop at least 10 seconds after closing bottles to insure                                that stable CTD data were associated with the trip and to allow the                                 SBE35RT tertiary temperature sensor time to make a measurement.                                                                                                                                         After the last bottle was closed, the console operator directed the                                 deckwatch to bring the rosette on deck.  Once on deck, the console                                  operator terminated the data acquisition, turned off the deck unit and                              assisted with rosette sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1.5.  CTD Data Processing                                                                                                                                                                               Shipboard CTD data processing was performed automatically during each                               LADCP/CTD/Rosette deployment, and at the end of each Trace Metals                                   rosette deployment using SIO/ODF CTD processing software.  The Trace                                Metals rosette contained its own CTD and carousel.  These data were                                 acquired using SBE SeaSave software, then copied to a Linux workstation                             for further processing.  No shipboard calibration was done for Trace                                Metals rosette CTD data.                                                                                                                                                                                Processing was performed during data acquisition for LADCP/CTD/Rosette                              deployments.  The raw CTD data were converted to engineering units,                                 ﬁltered, response-corrected, calibrated and decimated to a more                                     manageable 0.5 second time-series.  The laboratory calibrations for                                 pressure, temperature and conductivity were applied at this time.  The                              0.5 second time-series data were used for real-time graphics during                                 deployments, and were the source for CTD pressure and temperature                                   associated with each rosette bottle.  Both the raw 24hz data and the                                0.5 second time-series were stored for subsequent processing.  During                               the deployment the data were backed up to another Linux workstation.                                                                                                                                    Processing was performed after data acquisition for Trace Metals                                    rosette deployments.  The raw CTD data and bottle trips acquired by SBE                             SeaSave on the Windows XP workstation were copied onto the Linux                                    database and web server workstation, then processed to a 0.5 second time                            series and bottle trip values extracted.                                                                                                                                                                At the completion of a deployment a sequence of processing steps were                               performed automatically.  The 0.5 second time-series data were checked for                          consistency, clean sensor response and calibration shifts.  A 2 decibar                             pressure-series was then generated from the down cast.  Both the 2 decibar                          pressure-series and 0.5 second time-series data were made available for                             downloading, plotting and reporting on the shipboard cruise website.                                                                                                                                    LADCP/CTD/Rosette CTD data were routinely examined for sensor                                       problems, calibration shifts and deployment or operational problems. The                            primary and secondary temperature sensors (SBE 3) were compared to each                             other and to the SBE35 temperature sensor. CTD conductivity sensors (SBE 4)                         were compared and calibrated by examining differences between CTD and                               check-sample conductivity values. The CTD dissolved oxygen sensor data                              were calibrated to check-sample data. Additional TS and theta-O2                                    comparisons were made between down and up casts as well as with                                     adjacent deployments. Vertical sections were made of the various                                    properties derived from sensor data and checked for consistency.                                                                                                                                        Few CTD acquisition and processing problems were encountered during                                 I8S.  A clogged bleeder valve in the primary pump circuit led to                                    aborting cast 29/1 at 100M, then redeploying after cleaning the valve.                              The cast was not renamed.  Wire problems (resulting in reterminations)                              were apparent in the downcasts of 31/1, 32/1 and 33/2 and were ﬁltered                              out.  Slipring problems on 43/1 were evident on the upcast and were                                 ﬁltered out.  Bioﬁlm artifacts contaminated the downcasts on 29/1 and                               50/2.  29/1 was ﬁltered, the upcast was used for 50/2.  The ﬂuorometer                              endcap covers were left on for 2/1, 3/1 and 4/1.  A ﬂuorometer dark                                 cast was made for 12/1.  The transmissometer was changed on 69/1, then                              changed back on 83/1.                                                                                                                                                                                   A total of 88 casts were made using the 36-place LADCP/CTD rosette, and                             39 using the 12-place Trace Metals rosette.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1.6.

CTD Shipboard Calibration Procedures                                                                                                                                                              CTD #381 was used for all LADCP/CTD rosette casts on I8S.  The CTD was                              deployed with all sensors and pumps aligned vertically, as recommended                              by SBE.  The primary temperature and conductivity sensors (T1 & C1)                                 were used for all reported CTD data on all casts except 50/2, the                                   secondary sensors (T2 & C2) serving as calibration checks.  The SBE35RT                             Digital Reversing Thermometer (S/N 3528706-0035) served as an                                       independent calibration check for T1 and T2.  In-situ salinity and                                  dissolved O2 check samples collected during each cast were used to                                  calibrate the conductivity and dissolved O2 sensors.                                                                                                                                                    The variability of the environment that was observed on many of the                                 deployments made sensor and check sample comparisons somewhat                                       problematic.  An independent metric of variability was inferred from                                comparing primary and secondary temperature data.  This metric was used                             to ﬁlter check sample comparisons for calibration purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1.7.1.  CTD Pressure                                                                                                                                                                                    The Paroscientiﬁc Digiquartz pressure transducer (S/N 58952) was                                    calibrated in December 2006 at the SIO/ODF Calibration Facility.                                    Calibration coefficients derived from the calibration were applied to                               raw pressures during each cast.  Residual pressure offsets (the                                     difference between the ﬁrst and last submerged pressures) were examined                             to check for calibration shifts.  All were < 0.7db, and the sensor                                  exhibited < 0.3 db offset shift over the period of use.  No additional                              adjustments were made to the calculated pressures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1.7.2.

It is                                   triggered by the SBE32 carousel in response to a bottle closure.                                    According to the Manufacturer's speciﬁcations the typical stability is                              0.001&deg;C/year.  The SBE35RT on I8S was set to internally average over                                approximately one ship roll period (8 seconds).  It was located                                     equidistant between T1 and T2 with the sensing element aligned in a                                 plane with the T1 and T2 sensing elements.                                                                                                                                                              Two independent metrics of calibration accuracy were examined.  The primary                         and secondary temperatures were compared at each bottle closure, and the                            SBE35RT temperatures were compared to primary and secondary temperatures                            at each bottle closure.  These comparisons showed all three temperatures                            to be within ±0.001&deg;C with the SBE35RT between T1 and T2, so T1 and T2 were                         both corrected to the SBE35RT.  No sensor drift was evident and only one                            sensor (T2) exhibited any secondary responses (to pressure).  The residual                          differences after correction are shown in ﬁgures 1.7.2.0 and 1.7.2.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Figure 1.7.2.0: T1-T2 by station (P>1000db).                                                        Figure 1.7.2.1: SBE35RT-T1 by  station (P>1000db).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1.7.3.

To reduce                                the contamination of the comparisons by package wake, differences                                   between primary and secondary temperature sensors were used as a metric                             of variability and used to qualify the comparisons.  The coherence of                               this relationship is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.7.3.0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Figure 1.7.3.0: C1-C2 byT1-T2, all points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One of the sensors (C2) exhibited a secondary pressure response.                                    Otherwise the sensors tracked within ±0.001mS/cm the entire cruise                                  exhibiting no drift.

The ﬁtting                                      procedure determined the calibration coefficients for the sensor model                              conversion equation, and was accomplished in stages.  The time                                      constants for the exponential terms in the model were ﬁrst determined                               for each sensor.  These time constants are sensor-speciﬁc but                                       applicable to an entire cruise.  Next, casts were ﬁt individually to                                check sample data.  The resulting calibration coefficients were then                                smoothed and held constant during a reﬁt to determine sensor slope and                              offset.                                                                                                                                                                                                 Standard and blank values for bottle oxygen data were smoothed and the                              bottle oxygen recalculated prior to the ﬁnal ﬁtting of CTD oxygen.                                                                                                                                      The residuals are shown in ﬁgures 1.7.4.0-1.7.4.2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Figure 1.7.4.0: O2 residuals by cast (all points).                                                  Figure 1.7.4.1: O2 residuals by pressure (all points).                                              Figure 1.7.4.2: O2 residuals by cast (-0.005&deg;C≤T1-T2≤0.005&deg;C).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The standard deviations of 2.93 uM/kg for all oxygens and 0.86 uM/kg                                for low-gradient oxygens are only presented as general indicators of                                goodness of ﬁt.

In-situ pressure and                                   temperature are ﬁltered to match the sensor response.  Time-constants                               for the pressure response τp, two temperature responses τTs and τTf,                                and thermal gradient response τdT are ﬁtting parameters.  The thermal                               gradient term is derived by low-pass ﬁltering the difference between the                            fast response (Tf)and slow response (Ts)temperatures.  This term is                                 SBE43-speciﬁc and corrects a non-linearity introduced by analog thermal                             compensation in the sensor.  The Oc gradient, dOc/dt, is approximated                               by low-pass ﬁltering 1st-order Oc differences.  This gradient term                                  attempts to correct for reduction of species other than O2 at the                                   sensor cathode.  The time-constant for this ﬁlter, τog, is a ﬁtting                                 parameter.

The temperature was noted on the sample log and was                               sometimes useful in determining leaking or mis-tripped bottles.                                                                                                                                         Once individual samples had been drawn and properly prepared, they were                             distributed for analysis.

These                                salinometers were modiﬁed by SIO/STS to provide an interface for                                    computer-aided measurement.  The water bath temperature was set and                                 maintained at a value near the laboratory air temperature (24&deg;C).                                                                                                                                       The salinity analyses were performed after samples had equilibrated to                              laboratory temperature, usually within 6-8 hours after collection.  The                             salinometers were standardized for each group of analyses (usually 1-2                              casts, up to ~75 samples) using at least two fresh vials of standard                                seawater per group.  Salinometer measurements were made by computer,                                the analyst prompted by the software to change samples and ﬂush.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Sampling and Data Processing                                                                                                                                                                            A total of 3306 salinity measurements were made (429 for Trace Metals)                              and approximately 180 vials of standard seawater (IAPSO SSW) were used.                                                                                                                                 Salinity samples were drawn into 200 ml Kimax high-alumina borosilicate                             bottles, which were rinsed three times with sample prior to ﬁlling.                                 The bottles were sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and                                Nalgene screwcaps.  This assembly provides very low container                                       dissolution and sample evaporation.  Prior to sample collection,                                    inserts were inspected for proper ﬁt and loose inserts replaced to                                  insure an air tight seal.  The draw time and equilibration time were                                logged for all casts.  Laboratory temperatures were logged at the                                   beginning and end of each run.                                                                                                                                                                          PSS-78 salinity [UNES81] was calculated for each sample from the                                    measured conductivity ratios.  The difference (if any) between the                                  initial vial of standard water and the next one run as an unknown was                               applied as a linear function of elapsed run time to the data.  The                                  corrected salinity data were then incorporated into the cruise                                      database.                                                                                                                                                                                               The estimated accuracy of bottle salinities run at sea is usually                                   better than ±0.002 PSU relative to the particular standard seawater                                 batch used.

The                                      titration of the samples and the data logging were controlled by PC                                 software.  Thiosulfate was dispensed by a Dosimat 665 buret driver                                  ﬁtted with a 1.0 ml buret.

[Culb91], but with higher                                         concentrations of potassium iodate standard (˜0.012N) and thiosulfate                               solution (˜55 gm/l).  Pre-made liquid potassium iodate standards were                               run every day (approximately every 2-4 stations), unless changes were                               made to the system or reagents.  Reagent/distilled water blanks were                                determined every day or more often if a change in reagents required it                              to account for presence of oxidizing or reducing agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sampling and Data Processing                                                                                                                                                                            2917 oxygen measurements were made.  Samples were collected for                                     dissolved oxygen analyses soon after the rosette was brought on board.                              Using a Tygon and silicone drawing tube, nominal 125ml volume-                                      calibrated iodine ﬂasks were rinsed 3 times with minimal agitation,                                 then ﬁlled and allowed to overﬂow for at least 3 ﬂask volumes.  The                                 sample drawing temperatures were measured with an electronic resistance                             temperature detector (RTD) embedded in the drawing tube.  These                                     temperatures were used to calculate uM/kg concentrations, and as a                                  diagnostic check of bottle integrity.  Reagents (MnCl2 then NaI/NaOH)                               were added to ﬁx the oxygen before stoppering.  The ﬂasks were shaken                               twice (10-12 inversions) to assure thorough dispersion of the                                       precipitate, once immediately after drawing, and then again after about                             20 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                             The samples were analyzed within 1-4 hours of collection, and the data                              incorporated into the cruise database.                                                                                                                                                                  Thiosulfate normalities were calculated from each standardization and                               corrected to 20&deg;C.  The 20&deg;C normalities and the blanks were plotted                                versus time and were reviewed for possible problems.  The blanks and                                thiosulfate normalities for each batch of thiosulfate were smoothed                                 (linear ﬁts) in two groups during the cruise and the oxygen values                                  recalculated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Volumetric Calibration                                                                                                                                                                                  Oxygen ﬂask volumes were determined gravimetrically with degassed                                   deionized water to determine ﬂask volumes at ODF's chemistry                                        laboratory.  This is done once before using ﬂasks for the ﬁrst time and                             periodically thereafter when a suspect volume is detected.  The                                     volumetric ﬂasks used in preparing stands were volume-calibrated by the                             same method, as was the 10 ml Dosimat buret used to dispense standard                               iodate solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Standards                                                                                                                                                                                               Liquid potassium iodate standards were prepared in 6 liter batches and                              bottled in sterile glass bottles at ODF's chemistry laboratory prior to                             the expedition.  The normality of the liquid standard was determined by                             calculation from weight.  The standard was supplied by Alfa Aesar and                               has a reported purity of 99.4-100.4%.  All other reagents were "reagent                             grade" and were tested for levels of oxidizing and reducing impurities                              prior to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1.12.

[Gord92].  The analog                               outputs from each of the four colorimeter channels were digitized and                               logged automatically by computer (PC) at 2-second intervals.                                                                                                                                            Silicate was analyzed using the technique of Armstrong et al. [Arms67].                             An acidic solution of ammonium molybdate was added to a seawater sample                             to produce silicomolybdic acid which was then reduced to                                            silicomolybdous acid (a blue compound) following the addition of                                    stannous chloride.  Tartaric acid was also added to impede PO4 color                                development.  The sample was passed through a 15mm ﬂowcell and the                                  absorbence measured at 660nm.                                                                                                                                                                           A modiﬁcation of the Armstrong et al. [Arms67] procedure was used for                               the analysis of nitrate and nitrite.  For the nitrate analysis, the                                 seawater sample was passed through a cadmium reduction column where                                 nitrate was quantitatively reduced to nitrite.  Sulfanilamide was                                   introduced to the sample stream followed by N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine                           dihydrochloride which coupled to form a red azo dye.  The stream was then                           passed through a 15mm ﬂowcell and the absorbence measured at 540nm.  The                            same technique was employed for nitrite analysis, except the cadmium column                         was bypassed, and a 50mm ﬂowcell was used for measurement.                                                                                                                                              Phosphate was analyzed using a modiﬁcation of the Bernhardt and                                     Wilhelms [Bern67] technique.  An acidic solution of ammonium molybdate                              was added to the sample to produce phosphomolybdic acid, then reduced                               to phosphomolybdous acid (a blue compound) following the addition of                                dihydrazine sulfate.  The reaction product was heated to ~55&deg;C to                                   enhance color development, then passed through a 50mm ﬂowcell and the                               absorbence measured at 820nm.                                                                                                                                                                           Explicit corrections for carryover in nutrient analyses are not made.                               In a typical AutoAnalyzer system, sample to sample carryover is ~ 1-2%                              of the concentration difference between samples.  This effect is                                    minimized by running samples in order of increasing depth such that                                 concentration differences between samples are minimized.  The initial                               surface samples were run twice since these samples followed standard                                peaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sampling and Data Processing                                                                                                                                                                            3306 nutrient samples were analyzed of these 429 were analyzed for                                  Trace Metal casts.                                                                                                                                                                                      Nutrient samples were drawn into 45 ml polypropylene, screw-capped                                  "oak-ridge type" centrifuge tubes.  The tubes were cleaned with 10%                                 HCl and rinsed with sample 2-3 times before ﬁlling.  Standardizations                               were performed at the beginning and end of each group of analyses                                   (typically one cast, up to 36 samples) with an intermediate                                         concentration mixed nutrient standard prepared prior to each run                                    from a secondary standard in a low-nutrient seawater matrix.                                        The secondary standards were prepared aboard ship by dilution from                                  primary standard solutions.  Dry standards were pre-weighed at the                                  laboratory at ODF, and transported to the vessel for dilution to the                                primary standard.  Sets of 7 different standard concentrations were                                 analyzed periodically to determine any deviation from linearity as a                                function of absorbence for each nutrient analysis.  A correction for                                non-linearity was applied to the ﬁnal nutrient concentrations when                                  necessary.  A correction for the difference in refractive indices of                                pure distilled water and seawater was periodically determined and                                   applied.  In addition, a "deep seawater" high nutrient concentration                                check sample was run with each station as an additional check on data                               quality.  The pump tubing was changed 3 times.                                                                                                                                                          After each group of samples was analyzed, the raw data ﬁle was                                      processed to produce another ﬁle of response factors, baseline values,                              and absorbences.

                                                             During the CLIVAR/CO2 2007 repeat of I8S, 14 autonomous CTD profiling floats                        were deployed along the cruise track in waters deeper than 2000 dbar. These                         floats are part of the Argo project (www.argo.ucsd.edu), and are provided by                        Dr. Steve Riser from the University of Washington. Each of these floats has                         been ballasted differently for different latitudes. Of these 14 floats, 9                           contain oxygen sensors, and 2 are "ice floats" that are part of the Antarctic                       field trial. These 2 "ice floats" are programmed to remain subsurface and                           store data when under sea ice. All floats were deployed at CTD stations, at                         the end of all station casts. All floats were deployed from the starboard                           stern of the ship, with the ship moving forward at about 1 knot. No CTD oil                         slick was found at any of the deployment stations. Deployment was done by                           using a rope to lower the floats from the deck to the water. All 14 floats                          successfully self-activated via pressure activation. Data from all Argo                             floats are publicly available in real-time via the two global servers at                            www.usgodae.org and www.coriolis.eu.org. The following are the approximate                          positions where the 14 floats were deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Float ID   Latitude   Longitude                                                                     --------   --------   ---------                                                                       5058     65 09' S   84 18' E                                                                        5062     63 57' S   83 08' E                                                                        5074     57 37' S   82 23' E                                                                        5079     56 54' S   83 18' E                                                                        5093     56 03' S   84 15' E                                                                        5071     53 06' S   87 29' E                                                                        5094     50 07' S   90 25' E                                                                        5072     47 09' S   93 09' E                                                                        5095     44 00' S   95 01' E                                                                        5073     41 00' S   94 59' E                                                                        5075     37 59' S   94 59' E                                                                        5100     35 00' S   95 00' E                                                                        5119     33 30' S   95 00' E                                                                        5092     32 00' S   95 00' E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          TOTAL DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC)                                                                                                                                                                  The DIC analytical equipment was set up in a seagoing container modified for                        use as a shipboard laboratory. The analysis was done by coulometry with two                         analytical systems (PMEL-1 and PMEL-2) used simultaneously on the cruise.                           Each system consisted of a 5011 coulometer (UIC, Inc.) coupled with a SOMMA                         (Single Operator Multiparameter Metabolic Analyzer) inlet system developed by                       Ken Johnson (Johnson et al., 1985,1987,1993; Johnson, 1992) of Brookhaven                           National Laboratory (BNL).  In the coulometric analysis of DIC, all carbonate                       species are converted to CO2 (gas) by addition of excess hydrogen to the                            seawater sample, and the evolved CO2 gas is carried into the titration cell of                      the coulometer, where it reacts quantitatively with a proprietary reagent                           based on ethanolamine to generate hydrogen ions.  These are subsequently                            titrated with coulometrically generated OH-. CO2 is thus measured by                                integrating the total change required to achieve this.                                                                                                                                                  The coulometers were each calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2                              (99.99%) by means of an 8-port valve outfitted with two sample loops (Wilke                         et al., 1993).  The instruments were calibrated at the beginning and end of                         each full station with a set of the gas loop injections.                                                                                                                                                Secondary standards were run throughout the cruise on each analytical system;                       these standards are Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) consisting of                              poisoned, filtered, and UV irradiated seawater supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of                        Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and their accuracy is determined                         shoreside manometrically.  On this cruise, the overall accuracy and precision                       for the CRMs on both instruments combined was 0.75 µmol/kg respectively                             (n=131).  Preliminary DIC data reported to the database have not yet been                           corrected to the Batch 78 CRM value, but a more careful quality assurance to                        be completed shoreside will have final data corrected to the secondary                              standard on a per instrument basis.                                                                                                                                                                     Samples were drawn from the Niskin-type bottles into cleaned, precombusted                          300-mL Pyrex bottles using Tygon tubing with silicone ends. Bottles were                            rinsed once and filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume taking care                       not to entrain any bubbles. The tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating                        a 6-mL headspace, and 0.12 mL of 50% saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a                        preservative. The sample bottles were sealed with glass stoppers lightly                            covered with Apiezon-L grease, and were stored at room temperature for a                            maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis.                                                                                                                                                                  Over 2500 samples were analyzed for discrete DIC; full profiles were                                completed on odd numbered stations, with replicate samples taken from the                           surface, oxygen minimum, Salinity Maximum, and bottom Niskin-type bottles.                          On the even numbered stations, samples were drawn throughout the water column                       with focus on the upper 1000m.  The replicate samples were interspersed                             throughout the station analysis for quality assurance of the integrity of the                       coulometer cell solutions. No systematic differences between the replicates                         were observed.                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to the samples drawn from the Niskin-type bottles, we collected                         underway surface (~5 meter) sea-water samples from the sea chest. We did on 4                       hour intervals this during the transit from New Zealand to station 1 and                            during the transit to Australia after the end of station 88.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                References                                                                                                                                                                                              Feely, R.A., R.

Surface seawater flows through a spiral spray head in                        the top at a rate of 2 ±0.5 l/min. The water spray through the ~0.5-l                               headspace and the turbulence of the water streams impinging on the surface of                       0.5 l of water cause the gases in water and headspace to equilibrate.  Excess                       water flows through an outlet at the bottom of the equilibrator into an over-                       the-side drain.  Two vents in the top of the equilibrator insure that the                           headspace remains at the measured laboratory pressure.  Headspace gas                               circulates in a closed loop driven by a KNF pump at 150 ± 50 ml/min.  From                          the equilibrator the gas passes through a condenser, a column of magnesium                          perchlorate, a mass flow meter (MFM), a 1.0 µm Acro(r) disk filter, the 12 ml                       sample cell of a Licor(tm) Model 6251 non-dispersive infrared analyzer (IR),                        and back into the equilibrator headspace.                                                                                                                                                               A second KNF pump draws marine air from an intake on the bow mast through 100                       m of 0.95 cm (= 3/8") OD Dekoron(tm) tubing at a rate of 6-8 l/min.  A filter                       of glass wool at the intake prevents particles from entering the gas stream.                        At designated times, the program diverts 175 ± 25 ml/min of air from this line                      into the Licor sample cell for analysis.  Excess marine air empties into a                          rotometer on the front panel of the valve box.                                                                                                                                                          Both sample streams (equilibrator headspace and marine air) are analyzed bone                       dry.  They pass first through a cold trap (condenser) at 3&deg;C and then through                       a column of magnesium perchlorate.  Standard gases also run through the                             magnesium perchlorate.                                                                                                                                                                                  A custom developed program run under LabView(tm) controls the system and                            graphically displays air and water XCO2 readings.  The program logs the                             voltage and temperature of the infrared analyzer, water flow, gas flows,                            equilibrator temperature, and barometric pressure.  The program writes all                          of this data to disk at the end of each measurement phase.                                                                                                                                              The details of instrumental design can be found in Wanninkhof and Thoning                           (1993), Ho et al. (1995), and Feely et al. (1998).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Sampling Cycle:                                                                                                                                                                                         The system runs on an hourly cycle during which three standard gases, three                         marine air samples, and eight surface water samples (from the equilibrator                          headspace) are analyzed on the schedule listed below.  A Valco multi-port                           valve selects the gas to be analyzed.  Each measurement phase starts by                             flowing either standard (@~50ml/min), equilibrator headspace (@~150 ml/min),                        or marine air (@~175 ml/min) through the Licor.  Fifteen seconds before the                         end of each phase, a solenoid valve stops the gas flow.  Ten seconds later,                         the program logs all sensors and writes the data to disk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Table 2.14.

While the sample was being stirred slowly, an approximately 2.5 ml                       aliquot of acid was added to bring the pH of the sample to ~3.5.  After 4.5                         minutes of vigorous stirring and bubbling with CO2 free air, additional                             aliquots of 0.05 mls of the acid were added.                                                                                                                                                            Sampling and data processing techniques                                                                                                                                                                 On every other station, complete profiles were drawn with up to 3 duplicates.                       On the alternate stations, sampling was done in conjunction with the D.I.C                          and C-14 sampling programs and typically consisted of less than full                                profiles.                                                                                                                                                                                               The samples were drawn from Niskin bottles into rinsed 280ml Pyrex serum                            bottles.  To avoid organic contamination during sampling, a silicon drawing                         tube (provided by the CDOM sampling group) was used.  Following collection,                         the samples were poisoned with 0.056 microliters of a saturated mercuric                            chloride solution.                                                                                                                                                                                      The volume of sample to be run for analysis was measured using a 100 ml                             calibrated pipet.  The filling and emptying of the pipet were controlled                            using an automated system consisting of a peristaltic pump, an aquarium pump                        (making the pipet a blow-out unit), solenoid pinch valves and a ChronTrol                           programmable timer/controller. This system allowed for the measurement of                           each sample to be run, the dispensing of this volume into the cell to be used                       during analysis, and the rinsings of the pipet between samples.                                                                                                                                         During analysis, after each addition of acid during the titration, the volume                       added, a cell temperature, and a millivolt reading were electronically                              recorded.  The data was then processed by applying a modified linear fit to                         the data falling between pH 3.5 and 3.0 in order to calculate a preliminary                         alkalinity value for each sample that was run.                                                                                                                                                          As titrations were completed, all preliminary alkalinity values were plotted                        versus pressure to check for samples that should be rerun.  Having this plot                        available proved very helpful in this regard.                                                                                                                                                           Calibration                                                                                                                                                                                             All equipment used in our analyses was calibration ashore prior to the cruise                       during the timeframe of December 2006 through January 2007.

Water samples were                              collected in specially designed Niskin bottles, that use a modified end-                            cap design to minimize the contact of the water sample with the end-cap                             O- rings after closing. Stainless steel springs covered with a nylon                                powder coat were substituted for the internal elastic tubing provided                               with standard Niskin bottles. When taken, water samples for CFC  were the                           first samples drawn from the 10-liter bottles. Care was take to                                     coordinate the sampling of CFCs with other samples to minimize the time                             between the initial opening of each bottle and the completion of sample                             drawing. In most cases, dissolved oxygen, 3He, samples were collected                               within several minutes of the initial opening of each bottle. To minimize                           contact with air, the CFC samples were drawn directly through the                                   stopcocks of the 10-liter bottles into 250 ml precision glass syringes                              equipped with three-way plastic stopcocks. The syringes were immersed in                            a holding tank of clean surface seawater held at approximately 0 degrees                            Centigrade until 30 minutes before being analyzed.  At that time, the                               syringe was place in a bath of surface seawater heated to 25 degrees C.                                                                                                                                 For atmospheric sampling, a ~100 m length of 3/8" OD Dekaron tubing was                             run from the CFC, van located on the fantail, to the bow of the ship. A                             flow of air was drawn through this line into the main laboratory using a                            Kadet pump. The air was compressed in the pump, with the downstream                                 pressure held at ~1.5 atm. using a backpressure regulator. A tee allowed                            a flow (100 ml min-1) of the compressed air to be directed to the gas                               sample valves of the CFC  analytical systems, while the bulk flow of the                            air (>7 l min-1) was vented through the backpressure regulator. Air                                 samples were only analyzed when the relative wind direction was within 60                           degrees of the bow of the ship to reduce the possibility of shipboard                               contamination.  Analysis of bow air was performed at 16 locations along                             the cruise track. At each location, at least five measurements were made                            to increase the precision. The measured concentrations are reported in                              Tables 1 and 2.  Concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air samples,                                seawater, and gas standards were measured by shipboard electron capture                             gas chromatography (EC-GC) using techniques modified from those described                           by Bullister and Weiss (1988).                                                                                                                                                                          For seawater analyses, water was transferred from a glass syringe to a                              glass-sparging chamber (~190 ml). The dissolved gases in the seawater                               sample were extracted by passing a supply of CFC-free purge gas through                             the sparging chamber for a period of 6 minutes at 175 ml min-1. Water                               vapor was removed from the purge gas during passage through an 18 cm                                long, 3/8" diameter glass tube packed with the desiccant magnesium                                  perchlorate. The sample gases were concentrated on a cold-trap consisting                           of a 1/16" OD stainless steel tube with a ~5 cm section packed tightly                              with Porapak Q (60-80 mesh) and a 22 cm section packed with Carboxen                                1004.  A neslab cryocool was used to cool the trap, to -70&deg;C.  After 6                              minutes of purging, the trap was isolated, and it was heated electrically                           to ~175&deg;C. The sample gases held in the trap were then injected onto a                              precolumn (~60 cm of 1/8" O.D. stainless steel tubing packed with 80-100                            mesh Porasil B, held at 80&deg;C) for the initial separation of CFC-12 and                              CFC-11 from later eluting peaks.  After the F12 had passed from the pre-                            column through the second precolum (5 cm of 1/8" O.D. Stainless steel                               tubing packed with  MS5A, 80&deg;C) and into the analytical column #1 (~170                             cm of 1/8" OD stainless steel tubing packed with MS5A and held at 80&deg;C)                             the outflow from the first precolumn was diverted to the second                                     analytical column (~150 cm 1/8" OD stainless steel tubing packed with                               Carbograph 1AC, 80-100 mesh, held at 100&deg;C).  After CFC-11 had passed                               through the first precolumn, the remaining gases were backflushed from                              the precolumn and vented.  Column #1 and the precolumns were in a Shimadzu                          GC8 gas chromatograph with electron capture detector (340&deg;C).  Column #2                            was in a Shimadzu Mini2 gas chromatograph, also with electon capture                                detector (250&deg;C).                                                                                                                                                                                       Both of the analytical systems were calibrated frequently using a                                   standard gas of known CFC composition. Gas sample loops of known volume                             were thoroughly flushed with standard gas and injected into the system.                             The temperature and pressure was recorded so that the amount of gas                                 injected could be calculated. The procedures used to transfer the                                   standard gas to the trap, precolumn, main chromatographic column, and EC                            detector were similar to those used for analyzing water samples. Four                               sizes of gas sample loops were used. Multiple injections of these loop                              volumes could be made to allow the system to be calibrated over a                                   relatively wide range of concentrations. Air samples and system blanks                              (injections of loops of CFC-free gas) were injected and analyzed in a                               similar manner. The typical analysis time for seawater, air, standard or                            blank samples was ~11 minutes.  Concentrations of the CFCs  in air,                                 seawater samples, and gas standards are reported relative to the SIO98                              calibration scale (Cunnold et al., 2000). Concentrations in air and                                 standard gas are reported in units of mole fraction CFC in dry gas, and                             are typically in the parts per trillion (ppt) range. Dissolved CFC                                  concentrations are given in units of picomoles per kilogram seawater                                (pmol kg-1). CFC  concentrations in air and seawater samples were                                   determined by fitting their chromatographic peak areas to multi-point                               calibration curves, generated by injecting multiple sample loops of gas                             from a working standard (PMEL cylinder 45186) into the analytical instrument.                       The response of the detector to the range of moles of CFC passing through the                       detector remained relatively constant during the cruise. Full-range calibration                     curves were run at intervals of 4-5 days during the cruise. Single injections                       of a fixed volume of standard gas at one atmosphere were run much more                              frequently (at intervals of ~90 minutes) to monitor short-term changes in                           detector sensitivity.                                                                                                                                                                                   On this expedition, based on the analysis of 150 duplicate samples, we                              estimate precisions (1 standard deviation) of less than 1% or 0.005                                 (whichever is greater) for both dissolved CFC-11 and  CFC-12                                        measurements.  A very small number of water samples had anomalously high                            CFC concentrations relative to adjacent samples. These samples occurred                             sporadically during the cruise and were not clearly associated with other                           features in the water column (e.g., anomalous dissolved oxygen, salinity,                           or temperature features). This suggests that these samples were probably                            contaminated with CFCs during the sampling or analysis processes.                                   Measured concentrations for these anomalous samples are included in the                             preliminary data, but are given a quality flag value of either 3                                    (questionable measurement) or 4 (bad measurement). A quality flag of 5                              was assigned to samples which were drawn from the rosette but never                                 analyzed due to a variety of reasons (e.g., leaking stopcock, plunger                               jammed in syringe barrel).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  References                                                                                                                                                                                              Bullister, J.L., and R.F.

Samples were collected using a                                specially designed rosette system which consists of 12 x 12L Go-Flo bottles                         mounted on a powder-coated  rosette frame.  The package is equipped with a                          SeaBird SBE 911 ctd that also has an SBE 43 oxygen sensor and a Wet Labs FL1                        fluorometer.  The package is lowered using a Kevlar conducting cable and                            bottles were tripped at pre-determined depths from the ship using a deck box.                       Water samples were collected in the upper 1000 m at a total of 37 stations,                         spaced at ~1 degree intervals.                                                                                                                                                                          Dissolved Al, Fe and Mn were determined on these water samples using                                shipboard FIA (C.I. Measures, University of Hawaii).  In addition samples                           were collected for shore-based ICP MS determinations of dissolved and                               dissolvable Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb by isotope dilution (W.M. Landing,                           FSU).  Additional samples were collected by Amir Hamidian for shore-based Cd                        determinations at Otago University, New Zealand.  Particulate samples were                          also collected for shore-based determination of trace elements by EDXRF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    TRACE METALS ROSETTE SAMPLING:                                                                      (Dr. William M. Landing and Clifton S. Buck/FSU)                                                                                                                                                        We deployed the trace metals rosette at 37 stations, collecting roughly 450                         samples. Bad weather (high winds and rough seas) prevented us deploying at                          several stations. We had some electrical issues that caused two casts to be                         aborted at Stations 042 and 043 respectively.  The problems were resolved by                        a combination of reseating of signal cables and retermination of the Kevlar                         cable.  We also did not collect samples at Station 001 because the bottles                          did not trip correctly as the pylon was frozen while on deck from a fresh                           water rinse normally given to the rosette before deployment.                                                                                                                                            Subsamples were taken from each GoFlo bottle for at-sea analysis of salinity,                       nutrients, and dissolved total Fe and Al (Bill Hiscock of the Measures                              Group).

The purpose of                        the FSU aerosol sampling program is primarily to measure the concentration of                       total aerosol Fe, and to quantify the aerosol Fe fractions that are soluble                         in natural surface seawater and in ultra-pure deionized water. Additional                           analyses are conducted on the samples in an effort to understand the                                atmospheric processes that yield differences in the aerosol Fe solubility.                                                                                                                              The aerosol sampling equipment consists of four replicate filter holders                            deployed on a 20' fold-down aerosol tower mounted on the forward, starboard                         corner of the 03 deck of the ship. One of the replicate filters (0.4 µm                                                                                                                                 Nuclepore polycarbonate track-etched) is used for total aerosol measurements                        (see below); one replicate filter (0.45 µm polypropylene) is used to quantify                       the seawater-soluble fraction; one replicate filter (0.45 µm polypropylene) is                      used to quantify the ultra-pure deionized water soluble fraction; and one                           replicate filter (0.45 µm polypropylene) is used for precision (QA) tests or                        stored as a backup sample. Size-fractionated aerosols are also collected for                        72 hour intervals starting every fourth day using a MOUDI cascade impactor                          (>3.2 µm, 1.0 µm, 0.56 µm, 0.056 µm).                                                                                                                                                                   Air is pulled through the filters using two high-capacity vacuum pumps. The                         sampling is controlled by a Campbell Scientific CR10 datalogger that                                immediately shuts off the flow when the wind might blow stack exhaust forward                       towards the sampling tower, or when the wind drops below 0.5 m/s. Air flow is                       measured using Sierra mass-flow meters.                                                                                                                                                                 We have collected 24-hour integrated aerosol samples each day for the entire                        leg (23 days of sampling) for the following analyses:                                                                                                                                                     &bull; Total aerosol Si, Al, Fe (to be analyzed using Energy Dispersive X-Ray                              Fluorescence by Dr. Joe Resing at NOAA/PMEL).                                                     &bull; Seawater-soluble aerosol Al and Fe (to be run back at FSU).                                       &bull; Ultra-pure water soluble Si, Al, Ti, Fe, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, sodium                         (to be run back at FSU). The MOUDI size-fractionated aerosol filters are also                       leached with ultra-pure water for these same analytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  OTHER SAMPLING                                                                                                                                                                                          We collected archived samples from each trace metal cast (37 stations,                              approx. 650 samples) for FSU shore-based analysis of dissolved Fe, Ni, Cu,                          Zn, Cd, and Pb using isotope dilution ICPMS.                                                                                                                                                            We collected 237 samples for Amir Hamidian of University of Otago who will                          analyze them for dissolved Cd.                                                                                                                                                                          The TSM from each trace metal cast was collected on 47 mm 0.4 um Nuclepore                          filters for EDXRF analysis of total particulate Si, Mn, Fe, and Al (Joe                             Resing, NOAA/PMEL).                                                                                                                                                                                     200 mL of rain was collected during a squall at 40&deg;S and 95&deg;E.  The samples                         were filtered and frozen for analyses at FSU for soluble Si, Al, Ti, Fe,                            chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and sodium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     LOWERED ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS                                                                                                                                                              Two lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler systems were brought on this                          cruise.  All instruments were manufactured by Teledyne R.D. Instruments.  One                       system was from University of Hawaii, and consisted of 150kHz broadband ADCP                        (BB150), manufactured in the mid-1990s.  The other was a pair of 300kHz "work                       horse" ADCPs, one of which was a higher-powered prototype (WH300 and HP-                            WH300, respectively).  Both systems are self-contained, attached to the                             rosette but not attached to the CTD cable.  Either system, when deployed, is                        powered by a 48V lead-acid gel cell (or absorbed glass mat) battery system,                         contained in an oil-filled plastic box sealed by a urethane sheet.  These                           batteries are a vast improvement over the older gas-filled pressure cases                           (usually aluminum).  The newer batteries are known as the Safe Orange Battery                       due to the color of the case.  In 300-400 CLIVAR casts there has been no sign                       of any of the internal oil getting out, and we maintain a vigilant watch for                        any leaks.                                                                                                                                                                                              Mainly due to the lower frequency, the older BB150 instruments are capable of                       greater profiling range than the newer instruments.  Each ping has more                             range, so a given vertical slab is sampled more during a cast by a BB150 than                       a WH300, which has half the range (or less)in a given profile. RDI does not                         manufacture the BB150 any longer.  The only current viable replacement is the                       WH system.  An individual WH300 can profile to the bottom of the ocean when                         particles exist throughout the water column (e.g. high latitudes).  In                              regions of low scattering (center of a gyre) they often cannot profile below                        1000-1500m.  WH instruments are usually used in pairs with one looking up and                       one looking down, to increase the number of samples in a vertical slab during                       a cast.  The HP-WH300 is a prototype RDI hopes will improve profiling range,                        especially in regions of low scattering.                                                                                                                                                                The plan for this cruise was to use the WH pair until scattering was                                sufficiently low that they were not profiling to the bottom.  At that time we                       would switch to the BB150, which would extend the range of each ping, and                           hence the depth to which the instrument can profile.                                                                                                                                                    During the long steam to the first station communication with the HP-WH300                          was problematic, and after opening the pressure case and reseating the PCMCIA                       memory card, it was determined that the bulkhead connector was also bad.                            Because the WH300 was potentially to weak an instrument to work alone, the                          BB150 was put on for the first  station.  Unfortunately, the BB150 was in a                         confused state, or its up/down mercury switch was stuck in the wrong                                position.  The first 7 casts were full of reasonable-looking data which were                        acquired with some incorrect transformation, so the final velocities are                            junk. On cast 8 we switched to the remaining functional instrument, the                             WH300.  That instrument did in fact profile to the bottom until cast 48.                            However, with increasing frequency, it only returned a very short cast                              (truncated after minutes).  Between casts 8 and 48, 4 casts were lost from                          this problem, three of which occurred close together.                                                                                                                                                   On cast 49 we switched to the BB150.  It has a single eroded pin in the                             bulkhead connector but is still functional.  A new cable and attention to                           seating the cable appear to have kept its connector  in good condition                              because the instrument had no problems from station 49 to 88 the BB150 had no                       problems.  One cast was lost because the  serial port on the acquisition                            computer failed at the time of deployment.  Because of all the earlier                              communications trouble, a quick decision was made to send the cast down with                        the LADCP  not pinging.  During the cast the PC was rebooted and the serial                         port functioned again.  As it turns out, the PC involved suffered a                                 catastrophic hard drive (or other hardware) failure at the end of the cruise                        (after all casts and backups).  It is not clear whether the  serial port                            failure was a harbinger of bad news.  Two casts were lost due to operator                           error.                                                                                                                                                                                                  In all, 34 WH300 casts were obtained and 38 BB150 casts were obtained. No                           data were acquired with the HP-WH300.  Spare bulkhead connectors and o-rings                        are en route to Fremantle awaiting a future date with these instruments.                                                                                                                                Final LADCP processing is the responsibility of the LDEO group, but the                             components are in place.  The shipboard data from the NB150 are of sufficient                       quality that they can be used on the second leg "live", and on this leg a                           final processed dataset will be available for the LADCP operator.  GPS                              position files are available for the entire cruise, and ODF (the CTD group)                         has provided a 1/2 second time series of pressure, temperature, salinity, and                       other variables, for use with LADCP processing.  Preliminary processing for                         leg 1 shows good agreement between the shipboard and lowered ADCP data in the                       upper 200m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 SHIPBOARD DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS                                                                                                                                                                     The Revelle has three Doppler sonars for measuring ocean velocity. One of                           these, a commercial 150kHz narrowband instrument, is considered to be the                           primary shipboard current profiler for CLIVAR cruises.  The other two "High-                        resolution Doppler Sonar System" (HDSS, 50kHz and 140kHz) were designed at                          Scripps Institute of Oceanography specifically for installation on the                              Revelle.  Their design characteristics were optimized for high-quality ocean                        shear measurements, and the ability to provide high-quality ocean velocity is                       under evaluation.  Comparison of the ocean velocity data from the HDSS and                          RDI instruments will enable a decision as to whether the HDSS velocities                            should be included in the shipboard final ocean velocity dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The CLIVAR Shipboard Ocean Velocity component                                                                                                                                                           The primary instrument (NB150) was made by R.D. Instruments (now owned by                           Teledyne) in the late 1980s.  The original commercial acquisition and                               averaging software ran under DOS and required a fairly slow computer.  A new                        acquisition system written at the University of Hawaii was temporarily                              installed on a laptop for the P16S CLIVAR leg in Jan 2005.  The laptop was                          subsequently replaced with an SIO-owned rack-mount unit.                                                                                                                                                The acquisition system (UHDAS, University of Hawaii Data Acquisition System)                        is written in C and Python; processing software is in C, Python, and Matlab.                        UHDAS acquires data from the NB150 instrument, gyro heading (for reliability),                      Ashtech heading (for accuracy), and GPS positions from various sensors.                             Single-ping data are converted from beam to earth coordinates using known                           transducer angles and gyro heading, and are corrected by the average Ashtech-                       gyro difference over the duration of the 5-minute profile.  This scheme                             insulates the heading correction against short gaps or loss of fixes.  For                          Ashtech gaps (up to 2 hours), the previous available correction is used.                                                                                                                                Groups of single-ping ocean velocity estimates must be averaged to  decrease                        measurement noise.  These groups commonly comprise 5 minutes. Bad pings must                        be edited out prior to averaging.  This is done by UHDAS using a collection                         of criteria tailored to the instrument type and frequency, and to the                               specific installation.                                                                                                                                                                                  UHDAS uses a CODAS (Common Oceanographic Data Access System) database for                           storage and retrieval of averaged data.  Various post-processing steps can be                       administered to the database after a cruise is over, but the at-sea data                            should be acceptable for preliminary work.                                                                                                                                                              UHDAS provides access to regularly-updated figures and data via the ship's                          network.  The software used is all open-source and is available via samba                           share and nfs export, as well as through the web interface. The web site has                        regularly-updated figures showing the last 5-minute ocean velocity profile                          with signal return strength, and hourly contour and vector plots of the last                        3 days of ocean velocity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shipboard Doppler sonar work on this cruise                                                                                                                                                             NB150:                                                                                                                                                                                                  UHDAS is undergoing a transformation to remove dependence on Matlab. This                           transition will take some time and of necessity takes place in increments.                          On this cruise, work towards that transition included development of                                preliminary versions of all figures used in batch processing and on the web                         site.  The UHDAS system provided a valuable test platform for the figures but                       they will not be incorporated into the system as they have been tested for                          robustness.  Updates to acquisition and processing code were implemented that                       addressed various bugs and improved reliability.  A revised transducer angle                        (orientation relative to the ship) is possible after this cruise  and will be                       updated on the acquisition computer.                                                                                                                                                                    A new Ashtech receiver was shipped out to Dunedin for this cruise because the                       previous one (an older ADU2 unit) had failed.  The new (replacement) deck                           unit is using the original antennas and survey configuration.  For the most                         part it has been reliable, but there were several times when it locked up and                       had to be restarted  (trace the correct power cable on the bridge, unplug it,                       wait 15 seconds, and plug it in -- a reset using the button was insufficient).                      Post-processing of the NB150 data will include an improved heading correction                       to account for the few long gaps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           HDSS:                                                                                                                                                                                                   On the P16S 2005 CLIVAR cruise, CODAS processing steps were adapted for use                         with the HDSS data.  Those instruments had, at the time, three beams and two                        beams out of four, for the 140kHz and 50kHz instruments, respectively.  In                          January 2006 the 140kHz was repaired and the broken 50khz beams were replaced.                      The HDSS data acquisition system is also undergoing a transformation, but for                       the moment, the data format and associated peculiarities are consistent with                        the present CODAS processing code.  One change to CODAS processing was made                         to accommodate a newer and more precise binary data storage standard required                       in newer Matlab versions (newer Matlab failed to read the binary HDSS data                          without this change).  This will be passed along to the proprietors of the                          HDSS system for their use.                                                                                                                                                                              HDSS data will be compared to NB150 data after the best final processing of                         each has been finished.  If the data look good, they will be included in the                        ADCP archive along with the NB150 data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CHROMOPHORIC DOM                                                                                                                                                                                        Project Title:    Chromophoric DOM -- A Photoactive Tracer of Geochemical Process                                                                                                                       PIs:              D.

CDOM is a poorly characterized organic matter pool that                            interacts with sunlight, leading to the production of climate-relevant trace                        gases, attenuation of solar ultraviolet radiation in the water column, and an                       impact upon ocean color that can be quantified using satellite imagery. We                          believe that the global distribution of CDOM in the open ocean is controlled                        by microbial production and solar bleaching in the upper water column, and                          relative rates of advection and remineralization in intermediate and deep                           waters. Furthermore, changes in the optical properties of CDOM and its                              relationship with DOC over time suggest the use of CDOM as an indicator of                          the prevalence of refractory DOC in the deep ocean. We are testing these                            hypotheses by a combination of field observation and controlled experiments.                        We are also interested in the deep-sea reservoir of CDOM and its origin and                         connection to surface waters and are making the first large-scale survey of                         the abundance of CDOM in the deep ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Activities on I8S and I9N:                                                                                                                                                                              Profiling Instruments                                                                                                                                                                                   Once each day we are casting a hand-deployed free-fall Satlantic MicroPro II                        multichannel UV/Visible spectroradiometer. This instrument has 14 upwelling                         radiance sensors and 14 downwelling irradiance sensors in wavelength bands                          ranging from 305 to 683 nm. The package also mounts a WetLabs ECO chlorophyll                       fluorometer, plus ancillary sensors including X-Y tilt, internal and external                       temperatures. The instrument is allowed to trail away behind the port-side                          stern, then free-falls to 150m and is hand-recovered. We are using the                              radiometric data to study the effects of CDOM on the underwater light                               environment, to validate satellite ocean radiance sensor data, and to develop                       new algorithms employing satellite and in situ optical sensor data to                               retrieve ocean properties such as CDOM light absorbance, chlorophyll                                concentration, and particulate backscattering.                                                                                                                                                          On the core CTD we are deploying a WetLabs UV fluorometer (Ex 370 nm, Em 460                        nm), which stimulates and measures fluorescence of CDOM. We are evaluating                          the use of this instrument to supplement or enhance bottle CDOM measurements,                       as bottle samples often do not have the depth resolution needed to resolve                          the observed strong near-surface gradients in CDOM concentration, and on                            cruises such as this we are not able to sample CDOM on every station.                               Differences between the fluorescence and absorption profiles, may reveal                            gradients in chemical composition of CDOM. On I8S the fluorometer has                               performed very well: problems with temperature compensation encountered on                          P16N have been corrected. Signal to noise ratios remain low for the open                            ocean areas we are studying.                                                                                                                                                                            This fluorometer is ganged to a WetLabs C-star 660 nm 0.1m pathlength beam                          transmissometer belonging to Dr. Wilford Gardner, TAMU. The transmissometer                         is used to gauge particle load in the water column, which can be calibrated                         to produce estimates of particulate carbon. Decline of the particle load with                       depth can then be related to POC flux, another element of the carbon system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Bottle Samples                                                                                                                                                                                          CDOM is at present quantified by its light absorption properties. We are                            collecting samples of seawater for absorption spectroscopy on one deep ocean                        cast each day. CDOM is typically quantified as the absorption coefficient at                        a particular wavelength or wavelength range (we are using 325 nm). We                               determine CDOM at sea by measuring absorption spectra (280-730 nm) of 0.2um                         filtrates using a liquid waveguide spectrophotometer with a 200cm cell. On                          I8S duplicate samples were collected at a rate of ca. 2 samples per cast. RMS                       differences in absorption coefficient at 325 nm between the duplicate samples                       were just over 0.003 m-1, which is ca. 4% of the average absorption                                 coefficient at that wavelength.                                                                                                                                                                         We also concurrently collecting samples for bacterial abundance and DOM                             characterization (including carbohydrate and neutral sugar analysis) to                             compare the distribution of these quantities to that of CDOM. In surface                            waters (< 300m) we are also estimating bacterial productivity of field                              samples by measuring the uptake of bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a non-                                radioactive alternative to the standard bacterial productivity technique                            using tritiated thymidine.                                                                                                                                                                              Because of the connections to light availability and remote sensing, we are                         collecting surface samples (from the ship's uncontaminated seawater system)                         for chlorophyll, carotenoid, and mycosporine-like amino acid pigment analysis                       (HPLC), chlorophyll a (fluorometric), and particulate absorption                                    (spectrophotometric). We are sporadically collecting large volume (ca. 2L)                          samples for CDOM photolysis experiments back at UCSB, and occasionally                              collecting large volume samples for POC analysis to compare with                                    transmissometer data. We have the cooperation of the Trace Metals group for                         the large-volume subsurface samples from their Go-Flo bottles. We are only                          analyzing the CDOM and chlorophyll a at sea and the rest of the samples we                          are preparing and storing for later analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Outreach Team                                                                                                                                                                                           The I8S Public Outreach Team is a collaboration between Pien Huang, Cassandra                       Lopez, and Daniel Park, formed through an independently submitted proposal to                       Chief Scientist Jim Swift. By using oceanography as an example, they intend                         to inform the public of the basic scientific process. They will reach both                          classrooms and the general adult public by means of written and multimedia                          features in print and on the web.                                                                                                                                                                       We have been documenting our experiences on an informal blog which has                              gathered a solid readership beyond our family and friends by becoming a                             surprise hit with Ms. Brice's 8th grade class. Throughout the cruise, we have                       been lucky to have had outreach opportunities presented to us. Mid-cruise, we                       were invited to submit materials to a new NSF program which feeds articles to                       the widely read and distributed website LiveScience.com. Our primary efforts,                       however, have been focused on gathering material for longer articles and a                          feature-length documentary.                                                                                                                                                                             We brought to this cruise very few preconceptions of oceanography, but                              through first-hand experience we have improved our understanding of ocean                           measurement. We've realized that data collection is a difficult and often                           tedious process, but having participated in field work we now appreciate this                       necessary effort in the context of developing and clarifying ocean and                              climate models. Better data inform better models which in turn will forecast                        climate to the benefit of society. We hope our projects will enable the                             public to see and value the contributions of every member of this cruise.                                                                                                                               And of course we've really enjoyed our time on the Revelle and the chance                           we've had to work closely with so many fun and talented people!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     GRADUATE STUDENTS                                                                                                                                                                                       Each of the four graduate students was asked to write some form of report or                        comments of their choice about their participation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             JJ Becker (UCSD/SIO)                                                                                                                                                                                    "Jim,                                                                                                                                                                                                   "Thanks for allowing me to participate on the I8S cruise.

I have been able to get a                          glimpse of the true nature of oceanography work.  Back in the land-locked                           state of Wisconsin, I had been struggling with my research in carbon cycle                          modeling because of a disconnect between my first-hand work experience and my                       physical surroundings, never experiencing the deep blue sea in the flesh.  I                        used to always joke that I study the North Atlantic in Wisconsin using a                            supercomputer in Colorado.  Before embarking on this voyage, I was excited to                       resolve this disconnect.                                                                                                                                                                                Being my first time at sea, I did not know what to expect.  Would I get sea                         sick?  Could I do the work required of me?  Would I enjoy the people on                             board?  Would I like the food?  Fortunately, the answer to all these                                questions was "yes" (unfortunately so was the first one, but I found my sea                         legs eventually).                                                                                                                                                                                       "For the most part, the work was quite enjoyable, a different change of pace                        from my life of working with FORTRAN, FERRET, and MATLAB.  Literally getting                        my hands dirty (and wet), I enjoyed the challenges that came with life on a                         ship, working on the rosette and its instruments and the related computing                          tools to "drive" this VW-beetle-on-a-wire to the ocean floor.  Preparing the                        rosette allowed for a basic understanding of the mechanics of ocean data                            collection.  Deployment and recovery were particularly challenging and                              exciting (I know I'm not supposed to use this word), a physical challenge to                        guide a 15 foot pole in 40 knot winds to attach a tag line in rough seas.                           Sampling and the art of the "sample-cop" was a fun time, usually a jovial yet                       professional atmosphere as everyone joked and sampled their way around the                          rosette.  And while the actual "driving" of the rosette had its boring                              moments, I did enjoy sitting at the computer hearing Jim's sea/life stories                         and picking his brain for a better understanding for big-picture and small-                         scale physical oceanography.  It was fun to watch the data write itself in                          front of our eyes, truly real-time oceanography.                                                                                                                                                        "Perhaps the best part of this cruise were the people on board.  From the                           stories I've heard, things are not always as nice as on this cruise.                                Everyone was pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Life on this ship could                         have been much worse if the scientists and crew were not so agreeable.  I                           feel fortunate to have experienced my first cruise with such a group.  I                            really enjoyed hearing about everyone's previous experiences, quite amazing                         to have so many experts in oceanography in such a small amount of space.  I                         felt comfortable to ask any kind of question, and most questions could be                           answered by someone on board.  I really tried to draw upon all the expertise                        on board.  My goal on this trip was to be a sponge for information.                                 Fortunately there was a lot of water to absorb on a boat in the middle of the                       sea.  I was particularly glad to have J.J. as my partner-in-crime, a man with                       a great amount of experience and knowledge (and a superior sense of humor).                         The pairing of experienced and inexperienced graduate students was a great                          idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                   "Finally, I would like express my great thanks to Jim Swift for allowing me                         to come along on this cruise.  I know that it was quite a gamble to bring                           along some unknown kid from the Midwest all the way to the Southern Ocean,                          but I'm glad that he took the chance.  I hope that my presence on this cruise                       was as helpful to the research goals of the project as it has been to my own                        education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Dian Putrasahan (UCSD/SIO)                                                                                                                                                                              The I8S cruise is the first research cruise that I have participated and it                         has been a wonderful experience. At the beginning of the cruise, the main                           concern was the extent and duration of my seasickness. It was rather worrying                       if the motion sickness did not wear off, since it would affect my ability to                        work onboard. However, the one-and-a-half week steam to the first station                           gave ample time to adapt to the motion and switch my time schedule to get                           into the work shift (midnight to noon).                                                                                                                                                                 "Being a modeler, I had no idea how data is collected, how much effort it                           took and the obstacles that can occur such as equipment and instruments that                        would generate outrageous results or discontinuities, mechanical problems                           with the cable, human mistakes, data outliers, etc. This cruise has exposed                         me to some of the many problems that come along with data collection at sea,                        not only sampling uncertainties, but also working in rocky conditions.                              However, it was during this period of time that I got to learn many things.                                                                                                                             "As a graduate student, the main task was to help deploy and retrieve the                           rosette, as well as sample for nutrients and salts. Occasionally, I would be                        on the console watching and relaying the wire out, observing the tension in                         the cable, and calculating how far deep the rosette can go, making sure it                          does not hit the bottom. In the course of casting at stations, one realizes                         the importance of teamwork for the deployment and retrieval of the rosette.                         There were 5 people on the deck working together to cast at the stations (2                         at the outboard, one on the inboard, the resident technician (person in-                            charge) and the boom operator). It was very important to secure the taglines                        and ensuring they do not knot. For this, I learnt how to tie the bowline                            knot. Most of the time, I was the boon operator, in which I had to listen                           carefully for instructions to pull in or push out the frame and landing the                         rosette onto the cart. After the rosette has been retrieved, I would flush                          the sensors with freshwater and proceed to sample cop. A sample cop is there                        to make certain that samples were taken in the right sequence, with the                             extraction for gas samples given as a priority. Half-way through being a                            sample-cop, I would usually pass it on to someone else so as to help draw                           nutrient and salt samples. This in itself has now become second nature. Once                        all the samples have been taken, the Niskin bottles are then drained, and                           then I would that sample logs to make copies, scan them, and place them                             online for all to use. It is then followed by preparing the rosette for the                         next cast, which includes closing the vents and spigots and cocking the                             Niskin bottles.                                                                                                                                                                                         "Aside from sampling, I had learnt to run salts on the auto-sampler. First it                       was learning how to do it, trying to have it become second nature. And then                         slowly noticing how the salinity profile looked like and comparing them to                          the CTD salinity profile. It was important to note the air and bath                                 temperature (no more than +- 3&deg;C between air and bath temperature) to avoid                         drifting of the salinity readings. The sensitivity of salinity to temperature                       was clearly visible when drifting occurred. It was also essential to observe                        how the cells fill up, whether bubbles formed, and the pump speed to use to                         obtain more stable and reliable readings. It was vital for the salt runs to                         keep up with the sampling as there is a limited number of sampling bottles.                         Many a times, longer intervals are given between stations so as to allow more                       time for the analysis of chemicals.                                                                                                                                                                     "This cruise has certainly given me great insights of doing fieldwork as an                         oceanographer. I have gained much knowledge and experience from it and would                        hope to contribute back from what I have received. I would be delighted to                          participate again in the future."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Lora Van Uffelen (UCSD/SIO)                                                                                                                                                                             "During the midnight to noon hours of the past six weeks I could barely be                          missed traversing the main hallway on the R/V Roger Revelle wearing a                               selection of brightly colored attire.  This attire was indicative of the                            tasks I was performing during my stint as a CLIVAR I8-S student research                            assistant in the southern ocean.                                                                                                                                                                        "First of all, there was the mustang or "pumpkin" suit.  This was a head-to-                        toe cocoon of vivid orange that kept me nice and warm out on the deck while                         we were deploying the rosette amongst the icebergs.  It doubled as a safety                         work vest while we were handling tag lines, leaning over the side of the ship                       to hook the rosette, and bringing it safely back aboard.                                                                                                                                                "After the rosette was secured in the sampling bay, the pumpkin suit was                            traded for a pair of yellow rain pants for the water-sampling phase of the                          rosette process.  These coveralls were protection against the sometimes sub-                        zero waters that came spilling out of the 36 Niskin bottles as we worked our                        way around the rosette filling flasks for nutrient and salt analysis.                                                                                                                                   "Lastly, there was the LADCP "uniform," which consisted of a pair of brightly                       colored Croc shoes and the teal LADCP fanny pack.  The Crocs were only part                         of the uniform because coincidentally Dr. Jules Hummon, who graciously                              imparted her knowledge of Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers,                               happened to wear orange Croc shoes while I sport yellow ones.  I had the                            opportunity on this cruise to learn a lot about the instrumentation and data                        collection process of the LADCP, and was able to look at some of the data                           immediately after it was acquired.  This was particular interest to me since                        my research area is ocean acoustics.  The fanny pack held such treasures as                         black electrical tape, which was used to seal the dummy plug onto the                               instrument's connector before it was deployed, and paper towels and kimwipes                        to dry the connector after recovery.  After the package was brought on deck,                        the data was downloaded and quality checked and the battery was recharged for                       the next cast.                                                                                                                                                                                          "Other things that kept us busy were monitoring the progress of the CTD as it                       descended, tripping bottles at specified depths on its ascent to the surface,                       preparing the rosette for a cast by cocking the bottles open, and playing                           sample cop while the various sampling groups took their turns around the                            rosette.  Despite the darkness of the night shift hours, this cruise was full                       of not only bright colors, but also great experiences.  Besides my                                  introduction to the LADCP, I have learned more about the geography and                              oceanography of the southern ocean, have seen my first iceberg and my first                         aurora australis, and I finally know how to tie a bowline."</pre></html>
